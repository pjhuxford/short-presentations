## Description
The dissertation explicitly defines 3-generator 7-relator presentations of alternating and symmetric groups, and corresponding generators in the standard copies of these groups. [Magma](http://magma.maths.usyd.edu.au/magma/) functions are supplied here which construct the relators as elements of an `SLPGroup` (short-line programs), as well as others which return the corresponding generators as permutations.
